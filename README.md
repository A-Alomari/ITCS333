# ITCS333-Project-G6
NOTE: I worked on the Campus news

The Campus Hub project aims to develop a centralized web platform that connects university students with various campus-related resources and services.

Each team member is responsible for one of the following modules: Events Calendar, Study Group Finder, Course Reviews, Course Notes, Campus News, Club Activities, or Student Marketplace. The goal is to create responsive, visually consistent interfaces that include a main listing page, item creation form, and detailed item view.

The project emphasizes the use of semantic HTML5, responsive design through CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind, Pico CSS), and adherence to accessibility and structural best practices. Also create an API using PHP that connects to a MySQL/MariaDB database. This API will serve as the backend for the assigned module, handling data storage, retrieval, and processing. Additionally, implement all JavaScript functionality for the module, including event handling, form validation, data fetching, and dynamic content rendering. The module should now be fully interactive and populated with data.
